Scapes are 10,000 unique pixel landscapes created by and stored on the Ethereum blockchain. Each is algorithmically composed from 107 traits, forming a distinct place — from quiet hillsides to lit city skylines, from ocean shores to deep space.

Originally built in July 2021 as "PunkScapes" by jalil.eth, the project broadened its scope to become a home for all, leaning on composability with many different artworks. Scapes are fully onchain — artwork, metadata, and rendering all live in smart contracts.

Over the years, the project has grown into a series of interconnected experiments: composable merges, generative music, interactive animations, a 27-year daily art exhibition, and a built-in marketplace. Each layer builds on the original collection, treating the 10,000 pixel landscapes as a foundation for many creative experiments.
