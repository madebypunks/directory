On January 4th 2023, CryptoNovo got scammed and lost most of his NFTs, including his iconic CryptoPunk #3706.

This website was set up to coordinate the different initiatives made to help novo recover the punk back. It contained the savenovo.com code and the novopixels.com collection code.

The NovoPixels initiative was dedicated to help Novo recover his lost punk, and acted as a reminder to be safe out here. The collection was made of 576 tokens, one for each pixel of punk #3706. Each token was worth 0.14 ETH, which would have made 80 ETH if minted completely (the price to get #3706 back). There were no royalties, with 100% of the proceeds sent to a recovery wallet set for buying Novo's punk back.
