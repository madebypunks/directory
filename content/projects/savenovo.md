On January 4th 2023, CryptoNovo was scammed and lost most of his NFTs, including his iconic CryptoPunk #3706. The community rallied together to create SaveNovo, coordinating different initiatives to help novo recover the punk.

The project included the NovoPixels collection - 576 tokens representing each pixel of punk #3706, priced at 0.14 ETH each to raise the 80 ETH needed for recovery. With no royalties, 100% of proceeds went directly to buying back Novo's punk.

This initiative represents the best of the CryptoPunks community - coming together to help a fellow punk holder in need. The mission was ultimately successful, and Novo recovered his beloved punk #3706.
