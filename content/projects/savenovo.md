On January 4th 2023, CryptoNovo got scammed and lost most of his NFTs, including his iconic CryptoPunk #3706.

This project coordinates different initiatives to help Novo recover the punk back, including the SaveNovo website and the NovoPixels collection.

### About NovoPixels

The NovoPixels collection is made of 576 tokens, one for each pixel of punk #3706. Each token is worth 0.14 ETH, totaling 80 ETH if fully minted (the price to get #3706 back). No royalties - 100% of proceeds go to the recovery wallet for buying Novo's punk back.
