"One Day I'll be a Punk"-Punks were minted on the Ethereum Blockchain as a free, one per wallet mint on September 4th, 2021 – at a time when CryptoPunks became unattainable for most. Each token is an exact copy of the original Punk, simplified on a black and white canvas.

The contract enforced random token assignment during mint, and that only one token can be held by a wallet at a time. This questioned more traditional collection and market mechanics.

They were the first collecton on Ethereum to mint to 10,000 individual wallets (100% ownership distribution).
