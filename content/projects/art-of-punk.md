Art of Punk is the world's first museum exhibition exclusively featuring artists from the CryptoPunk community. Curated by Tschuuuly (Julia Staudach), the exhibition ran from September 4, 2024 to January 26, 2025 at Francisco Carolinum in Linz, Austria, with a parallel presence in the Voxels metaverse.

## About the Exhibition

The exhibition offers a unique insight into the creative dynamics of a community operating at the intersection of art and technology. It highlights the role of NFTs as cultural artifacts that redefine both the art world and the understanding of ownership and authenticity in the digital age.

Traditional art forms such as painting and sculpture are presented alongside digital works including AI art, NFTs, generative art, on-chain art, poetry, and music.
