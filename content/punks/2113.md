Multidisciplinary builder blending entrepreneurship, code, and art. 15 years shipping products at the intersection of technology and culture—from TechList (2012), the crowdsourced map that catalyzed the French Tech movement, to today's experiments with embodied AI and robotics through kami.bot.

In the CryptoPunks universe: creator of PunkMaker, PUNK.CAM, Punks.art, PunkMap, and NakedPunks—a body of work exploring generative systems, pixel art, and digital identity. Featured in the "London Calling" exhibition (Paris, 2024) and speaker at EthCC and NFC Summit on physical-digital convergence.

Background spans finance (LSE), acting (Cours Florent), and full-stack development. Built and shipped across web3 (HIC.AF, Metahood), developer tools (way.js, react-sharesheet), and creative tech (meeb.cam, TurnMe.AI). Currently deep in AI agents and robotics—building machines that move, see, and act in the physical world.
