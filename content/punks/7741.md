Creator of ExpansionPunks, a 10,000-piece collection addressing diversity gaps in the original CryptoPunks. Reverse-engineered every pixel of the original collection to create female versions of zombies, apes, and aliens (all 121 rare types originally had male faces). Also created ittybits, the entire 10K punks compressed by 75% while retaining IDs and traits. Works in Marketing Ops at Google, previously spent 12 years at Microsoft.
