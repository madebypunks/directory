Georg Bak, known as SNOWCASH, is a Swiss curator and digital art historian exploring the history of digital art and cyberpunk culture. Based in Zug, Switzerland, he co-curated the SNOWCA$H touring exhibition at Kunsthalle Zürich (2022), named after Neal Stephenson's cyberpunk novel "Snow Crash." The exhibition bridged physical gallery spaces and multiple metaverses.
