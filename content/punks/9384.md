dark0 is a multidisciplinary artist whose practice spans illustration, digital painting, and system-based experimentation. Using technology as both medium and canvas, his work explores art, science, and contemporary digital culture. Through visual narratives, generative structures, and speculative concepts, he investigates themes of time, identity, data, power, and evolving social systems.

Blending painterly approaches with computational tools, his work reflects on how digital environments reshape perception, authorship, and human agency. Darko creates artworks that exist between image, system, and idea, questioning the role of the artist in an increasingly automated and networked world.
