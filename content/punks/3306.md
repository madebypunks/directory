Ilan Derech is a visual artist working across photography, film, and digital art, focused on capturing quiet, unposed moments of everyday life. Influenced by street photography and Japanese aesthetics, his practice centers on brevity, stillness, and imperfection, often expressed through vertical triptych videos that function like visual haiku.

His pieces are designed to feel like long memories, where time stretches and softens. By embracing imperfections, he evokes emotion and familiarity, using them as a bridge to the human side of the experience.

Ultimately, his work invites viewers to slow down and question how they experience time, what they are drawn to, and how presence shapes their connection to the world.
