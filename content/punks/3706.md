Former PE teacher turned full-time NFT collector and community builder. Known as the "Metaverse mascot," he famously wears an LED mask displaying his punk #3706 at events, bringing his digital identity into the physical world.

Started collecting toys and rare comics as a child in suburban Illinois. Entered NFTs in 2019 and made a legendary trade: bought a CryptoPunk Hoodie for 1.24 ETH ($400), later sold for 350 ETH (~$1M). Built a collection valued at $4M, including $2.5M in CryptoPunks.

In January 2023, he lost punk #3706 in a scam. The community rallied through the SaveNovo initiative, helping him recover his iconic punk. Featured in Cointelegraph and cited in the New York Times as "the owner of CryptoPunk #3706."
