The NFT Attorney. Founder of JTM Tech Law and General Partner at 2 Punks Capital. While in law school, founded a legal tech startup focused on tying testamentary documents to the blockchain.

One of the first lawyers to fully embrace the NFT space, advising artists, collectors, DAOs, and auction houses on all things crypto and NFT. Eventually made more from investing than practicing law, leading him to launch 2 Punks Capital with his partner Steven.
