Erick Calderon, known as SnowFro, is the founder and CEO of Art Blocks - the platform that pioneered on-chain generative art with over $1.4B in sales. Creator of Chromie Squiggles.

His NFT journey started in 2017 when he minted 34 CryptoPunks after discovering them on Reddit. He later sold some to fund Art Blocks development. As he puts it: "I don't know that I would be here today if it wasn't for the CryptoPunks."

Punk #1478 is a Zombie - his iconic PFP.
