Co-founder of Larva Labs and co-creator of CryptoPunks, the first NFT project on Ethereum. Graduated from Trinity College in 1998 with a degree in computer science and mathematics. Together with John Watkinson, created CryptoPunks (2017), Autoglyphs (2019), and Meebits (2021). Recalls the "deafening silence" when CryptoPunks launched—only 800-1,000 claims in the first week. CryptoPunks are now in major museum collections including MoMA, Centre Pompidou, LACMA, and ICA Miami.
